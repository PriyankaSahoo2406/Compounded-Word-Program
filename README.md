## Overview of the program :
This program reads two input text files (`Input_01.txt` and `Input_02.txt`) containing alphabetically sorted words. It identifies the longest compounded word and the second-longest compounded word within the files. A compounded word is one that can be constructed by concatenating shorter words also found in the same file.

## Execution steps :
1. Place the input text files (`Input_01.txt` and `Input_02.txt`) in the same directory as the 'Solution.java' program.
   
2. Open the terminal
 
3. Compile the Java program by typing the command :- javac Solution.java

4. Run the program by typing the command :- java Solution

5. The program will process the input files and display the longest compounded word, the second-longest compounded word, and the time taken for processing each file.

## Output :
For Input_01.txt:
<br>
Longest compounded word: ratcatdogcat
<br>
Second longest compounded word: dogcatsdog
<br>
Time taken to process: 0.0 seconds

For Input_02.txt:
<br>
Longest compounded word: electroencephalographically
<br>
Second longest compounded word: phosphatidylethanolamines
<br>
Time taken to process: 0.264 seconds
